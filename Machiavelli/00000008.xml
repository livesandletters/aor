        				Nothing to me is singular or distinguished, without the War of Caesar: in which together,
        				are all precepts and examples for waging war most fiercely and most expertly,
        				that is, most victoriously. To which however necessarily a few new inventions must be added,
        				chiefly Pyrotechnics and Fortifications. The activities of Vulcan and Daedalus;
        				all such proofs, easy things: (As in Petrus Navarra and Carolus Tettus): nor does fiery Polymechania 
        				ever remain fixed in water. He who imitates, in the one, Vulcan or Prometheus, in the other, Daedalus,
        				or Archimedes, most dextrously will he be able to achieve what he wishes, and most efficiently.
