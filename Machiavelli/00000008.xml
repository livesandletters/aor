                    					A necessary Preamble to the Art of Warr.
                    					The Art of Defence: the Art of Riding: the Art of 
                    					Nauigation: three necessary Arts for euery publique,
                    					or priuate Actor in the world; that intendeth to
                    					trauail, or to do anything abroad. And if he
                    					purposeth to sturr in greater actions; he must not
                    					want the Art of Warfare: With the brauest new 
                    					Inuentions of Pyrotechny, Fortification, &amp; such like.
                    					And also with the new Aggiunta of Gandino,

                    					A Brave Executioner, or gallant Traueler by land, or sea,
                    					may better want any other Arte of whatsoeuer importance,
                    					then these, that necessarily apperteine to the defence
                    					of his owne person, his goode, his friende, &amp;c.

        				Nothing to me is singular or distinguished, without the War of Caesar: in which together,
        				are all precepts and examples for waging war most fiercely and most expertly,
        				that is, most victoriously. To which however necessarily a few new inventions must be added,
        				chiefly Pyrotechnics and Fortifications. The activities of Vulcan and Daedalus;
        				all such proofs, easy things: (As in Petrus Navarra and Carolus Tettus): nor does fiery Polymechania 
        				ever remain fixed in water. He who imitates, in the one, Vulcan or Prometheus, in the other, Daedalus,
        				or Archimedes, most dextrously will he be able to achieve what he wishes, and most efficiently.
        					<!-- Unclear about translating "talia omnia Experimenta, facilia" or the relevance/significance of "nec usquam in aquis, etc." --> <!--JG: I think it's pretty accurate, although I'm not entirely sure either. James, what do you think?-->
