    			Some other emblems of Alciato, both warlike 
    			and otherwise inducing.
    			
    			Fortune, companion of virtue.
    			Encircled by a pair of snakes and wings, 
    			the caduceus rests upright between the horns of Amalthea. 
    			Thus it shows that a great abundance of things 
    			"blesses men who are strong of mind and skilled in speaking." <!-- Alciato's Book of Emblems, no. 119. Translation from http://www.mun.ca/alciato/e019.html] -->
    			
    			Fortune overcoming virtue.
    			When Brutus was vanquished by the Caesarean host, 
    			he saw Pharsalia awash in the blood of citizens, 
    			and now about to draw his sword and plunge it into his breast in death, 
    			he delivered from his bold lips these words: 
    			Unhappy virtue, wise only in words, 
    			"why in life's flux do you yield to Mistress Fortune?" <!-- Alciato's Book of Emblems, no. 120. Translation from http://www.mun.ca/alciato/e120.html -->
    			    			
    			(Indeed the virtue of Brutus, nothing to the virtue of Caesar: 
    			the former a theory so full of words; the latter the active practice of virtue.)
    			    			
    			One must persist against repressions.
    			
    			A palm-tree struggles up against a weight, and rises in an arc; 
    			the more it is pressed down, the more it lifts its burden. 
    			It bears fragrant nuts, sweet desserts, 
    			to which first honour is given among courses. 
    			Go youth, and crawling amidst the branches, gather these things. 
    			"He who is of constant mind will carry off worthy prizes." <!-- Alciato's Book of Emblems, no. 36. Translation from http://www.mun.ca/alciato/e036.html --> 
   			
    			Against those who fall easily from virtue.    			
    			Small as a snail is the Remora, disdaining the force of wind,
    			and oars, is able to stop a ship by itself.
    			Thus some petty circumstance can check in mid-career certain men 
    			who are, by genius and by virtue, headed for the stars.     			
    			Likewise a tormenting law-suit, or a passion for a prostitute, 
    			"draws youths from their distinguished studies." <!-- Alciato's Book of Emblems, no. 83. Translation from http://www.mun.ca/alciato/e083.html -->
    			
    			
    			(but Appius the Decemvir seized a hindrance as an opportunity)
    			
    			Support that is never wanting.
    			
    			When I was overwhelmed on land, or overwhelmed at sea, 
    			I carefully escaped the double danger by a single piece of armour. 
    			My shield kept me safe from the line of battle; when 
    			I was shipwrecked, it carried me to shore as I clung to it. <!-- Alciato's Book of Emblems, no. 162. Translation from http://www.mun.ca/alciato/e162.html -->
