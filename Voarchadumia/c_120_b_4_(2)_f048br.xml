                And the reason for the invention of such bath was the extraction of a pure substance to its nature.
                Because through the first and second distillation of the substance there is a unique clearness in the bath of Saturn.
                Therefore, as seen in the modes of distilling, and what distillation is, we approach in the sediments.

                        Verum, secundum Hermete[m] In vna quaq[ue] re corruptibili tria sunt
                        consideranda: Primu[m] quod est vtile, Aqua: secundu[m], Oleum:
                        tertius, Fa[e]x. Tamen nullu[m] istoru[m] habet esse in corpore isto
                        corrupto, sed confusu[m] et indivisum: quod corpus ab aliquibus 
                        vocatur Hyle: Vnde dicitur Deus creavit primo coelos, et
                        terra[m]: quos coelos vocamus sublimatione[m], terra[m] vero corpus
                        nigrum. Et ex limo istius terra[e] plasmavit Deus Adam
                        et ex Adam viragine[m]: quod est corpus n[ost]r[u]m, in quo
                        sunt aliqua[e] essentia[e] corruptionis, qua[e] prohibentur. Vnde
                        inquit Alphidius Scito fili quod in libro fit librorum
                        perfectio: et certissimum est opus eis, qui ratiocinantur
                        jam ergo mandaui tibi quod proponis, videlicet Adam <!-- FSF: running over -->

                Truly, according to Hermes, any corruptible substance has three things that have to be taken into consideration:
                The first thing is usefil water, second its oil and third its dregs. 
                Yet he holds that none of these has an essence in that corrupt body, but a disordered and undivided one.
                Others call this kind of body hyle.
                From here, God is said to have created first the heavens and the earth. 
                Those heavens we call sublimation and the earth a black body.
                And from the soil of this earth, God moulded Adam and from Adam a woman.
                That is our body, in which there are some essences of corruption, which are restrained.
                About this Alphidius said: You must understand, my son, that perfection is achieved in the book of books
                and that the work is most certain for those who draw the right conclusions.
                I have entrusted to you what you propose, namely Adam.
