                        in Turba. Scitote quod si superficies dealbatur intrinseca eius dealbantur:
                        et si superficie[m] aeris dealbauerit, intrinseca eius dealbabuntur.

                        custodite ne pereat.
                        Sed qualiter generatur iste fumus albus? certe per putrefactione[m]
                        et mundificatione[m]. Prim&ograve; materia corrumpitur, fitq[ue]

                [On this Parmenides [says] in] the Assembly: You shall know that if the surface is whitened, the innermost of the body is white and if it has whitened the surface of the air, its innermost is whitened too.
                Likewise, Lucas [says]: Ruled by mercury, the entire body is whitened and nature converts nature. 
                Therefore, let in the dry and humid and extract the white smoke from them and preserve it so it does not die out.
                But how is this white smoke produced?
                Certainly through putrefaction and purification. 
                First, the matter is corupted and by the heat of fire it is separated from a consuming smoke that mostens the blackness from this white smoke, whics was beofre the mixture in the prime matter under one form nonetheless.
                And thus it undergoes the purification through one fire. For after a while it undergoes another purification through our art, that is through sublimation and distillation, as below.
                And this is what Hippocrates says in his Aphorisms: In the disturbance and vomit etc.
