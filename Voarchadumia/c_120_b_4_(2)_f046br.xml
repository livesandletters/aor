                [which is made through] separation of the consumed smoke from it in the putrefaction and cleansing, we shall see that which is made through sublimation and distillation.
                And first we shall see what sublimation is and why it was invented etc.

                Distillation is the separation of putrefied liquid from the sediments of its turbulence; and this was general. 
                In specific, however, it was the search for pure water so that an unbound body after its dissolution in water cannot be infected nor corrupted. 
                We place distillation in many modes, of course, through a retort and a sand bath.
