            <translation>Having thoroughly read the above two books, with careful scrutiny of individual actions, both public, and private, I have come to 
                understand in the end, that it was pivotal to distinguish most clearly the curiae, assemblies, laws, magistrates, customs, even the rewards and 
                punishments according to the type of Republic, and its form, each individually, and that all should be fitted in entirely, in the most suitable way. 
                For it is inappropriate that they oppose themselves either completely or partly, and it would be absurd to connect contrasting or unrelated means 
                to one and the same end. In this respect it cannot be denied that the Romans have often erred, and often other nations as well, by either being careless 
                about their own position in times of peace or forgetful in stormy times, or, as I would rather think, by being ignorant in both. So that they were more 
                prudent for themselves than for the Republic. For look wherever you wish in Roman history: everyone [strives] more for himself, than for the Republic; 
                the devotion to the household is greater, than that to the fatherland; there are more rich and respected housekeepers than fair and wise politicians.
